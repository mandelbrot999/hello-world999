/* This module defines the default integer used by the Tcl/Tk interpreters
** and by other software which does not explicitly deal with arbitrary length
** integers.  The hope is that, over time, the Tcl core can be migrated to use
** this functionality.  What should happen is that, with the flip of a preprocessor
** switch, the default integer size can be changed.
**
** The only real guideline for the size is that it must be at least as large
** as the maximum size of a file.
** 
** It is felt at the present time that 128-bit integers should be adequate for
** just about everything.
